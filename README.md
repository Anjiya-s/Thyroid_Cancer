** Thyroid Cancer Risk Prediction System **

** bold**

A Java-based machine-learning application that predicts thyroid cancer risk using a Random Forest classifier. The system ingests patient risk‑factor data from CSV, trains a robust model, and delivers real‑time risk predictions along with personalized health recommendations.

Features
High/low Risk Prediction
Classifies patients as high‐risk or low‐risk based on demographic and risk factors.

Personalized Recommendations
Generates tailored advice to mitigate risk (e.g., dietary iodine adjustments, lifestyle changes).

 Data Processing
Cleans, normalizes, and handles missing values in large CSV datasets.

Java Swing GUI
Intuitive desktop interface for data entry, batch import, and results display.

 Accuracy
Employs cross‑validated Random Forest (hyperparameter tuning) to achieve predictive performance.

Requirements
Java JDK 17 or higher

Maven for build and dependency management

4 GB+ RAM recommended for model training

Disk space for CSV datasets
